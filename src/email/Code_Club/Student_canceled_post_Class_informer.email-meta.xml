    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName}

We are sorry you couldn&apos;t make it to Code Club at Salesforce

The project you missed was: {!Class__c.Project_Topic__c}
Direct link: {!Class__c.Content_URL__c}

If you get the chance, and to keep up with the rest of the class, it would great if you could try to complete the project before the next class.

Remember that in order to save work you do on the project, you need to sign up for a Scratch account at https://scratch.mit.edu/ (if you haven&apos;t already done so)

We hope to see you at the next class and you&apos;ll get a reminder from us a couple of days beforehand

Best wishes,

Code Club Aotearoa</textOnly>
