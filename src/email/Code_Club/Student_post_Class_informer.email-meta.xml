    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName}

Thanks for coming to Code Club at Salesforce

We though we&apos;d send you details of what we covered on the class on : {!Class__c.Class_Date__c}

If you want to try the project for yourself or try extending it further:
The project was: {!Class__c.Project_Topic__c}
Direct link: {!Class__c.Content_URL__c}

Remember that in order to save your work, you need to sign up for a Scratch account at https://scratch.mit.edu/ (if you haven&apos;t already done so)

We hope you enjoyed the class and we look forward to seeing you again

You&apos;ll get a reminder from us a couple of days before the next class

Best wishes,

Code Club Aotearoa</textOnly>
