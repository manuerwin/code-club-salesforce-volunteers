This is to remind you that you are registered for Code Club at Salesforce.

Date/Time: {!Class__c.Class_Date__c}
Location: Salesforce, L26 PwC Tower, 188 Quay Street, Auckland

When you arrive at the Servcorp front desk, please ask for the Session Leader, {!Class__c.Session_Leader_Name__c} by name.

If for any reason, you can&apos;t make the session, can you please let the leader know in advance?  The leader&apos;s contact details are:

email: {!Class__c.Session_Leader_Email__c}
phone: {!Class__c.Session_Leader_Phone__c}

Please remember to bring your computer with you if you have one, but if you haven&apos;t, we should be able to allow you to borrow or share one.

If you are being brought by a parent, then they can join the session or sit in our reception and read the paper or look at the view.  There is also a kitchen with tea and coffee available

Looking forward to seeing you soon.

Regards,
