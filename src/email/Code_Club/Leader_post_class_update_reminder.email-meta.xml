    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName}

Thanks for running the class on : {!Class__c.Class_Date__c}
The records show that you were due to deliver the module: {!Class__c.Project_Topic__c}

If you haven&apos;t done so already, can you please
1. Ensure that the content shown against the Class is what you delivered
2. Set the Class Status to &quot;Delivered&quot;
3. Update the students and assistant&apos;s attendance status.
4. Add all students to next week&apos;s class.  If any can&apos;t attend, please add them anyway. Next week&apos;s leader will mark them present or absent. (The video says if they arent coming, then don&apos;t add them, but please ignore that bit - just go ahead and add them all)

Here&apos;s the video here that shows you how to add students to a class and record attendance in case you need a reminder
https://codeclub-nz.lightning.force.com/one/one.app#/sObject/ContentDocument/0697F000000cPdPQAU

As you do step 3, each Student will receive an email with details of the project that they worked on during the class so that they can finish the project at home if they didn&apos;t manage to do so during the class - and even try the extension exercises.

Update the Class details and attendee related list froim this link
https://codeclub-nz.my.salesforce.com/{!Class__c.Id}

...or you can update attendance records  from the attendance report:
Classic: https://codeclub-nz.my.salesforce.com/00O7F000001hzoN?&amp;pv0={!Class__c.Id}
Lightning: https://codeclub-nz.lightning.force.com/one/one.app#/sObject/00O7F000001hzoNUAQ/view?=undefined&amp;fv0={!Class__c.Id}

(Just in case you cant remember your username in this org, it is {!Class__c.Session_Leader_SF_Username__c})

...and don&apos;t forget to log your time in the Salesforce.org system.  Here&apos;s a direct link to the activity record where you can log your time once you have signed in via Aloha
