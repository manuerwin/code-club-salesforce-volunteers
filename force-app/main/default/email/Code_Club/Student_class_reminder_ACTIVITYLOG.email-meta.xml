    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName}

This is to remind you that you are registered for Code Club at Salesforce.

Date/Time: {!Class__c.Class_Date__c}
Location: Generator Board Room, The Generator, 12 Madden St Auckland

When you arrive at the Servcorp front desk, please ask for the Session Leader, {!Class__c.Session_Leader_Name__c} by name and tell the receptionist that you are here for Code Club in the Generator Board Room

If for any reason, you can't make the session, can you please let the leader know in advance?  The leader's contact details are:

email: {!Class__c.Session_Leader_Email__c}
phone: {!Class__c.Session_Leader_Phone__c}

Please remember to bring your computer with you if you have one, but if you haven't, we should be able to allow you to borrow or share one.

If you are being brought by a parent, then they can join the session or sit in our cafe, alternatively Wynyard Quarter is just a minute away.

Looking forward to seeing you soon.

Regards,

Code Club Aotearoa and Salesforce New Zealand
