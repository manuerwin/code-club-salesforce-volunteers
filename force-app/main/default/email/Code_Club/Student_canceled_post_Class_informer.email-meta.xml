    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName}

We are sorry you couldn't make it to Code Club at Salesforce

The project you missed was: {!Class__c.Project_Topic__c}
Direct link: {!Class__c.Content_URL__c}

If you get the chance, and to keep up with the rest of the class, it would great if you could try to complete the project before the next class.

Remember that in order to save your work, you need to sign up for a Trinket account at https://trinket.io/ (if you haven't already done so).  Note that students aged under 13 need parental permission and we'd recommend a parent helps create the account so that the username and password aren't mislaid

We hope to see you at the next class.  You'll get a reminder from us a couple of days beforehand as usual

Best wishes,

Code Club Aotearoa</textOnly>
